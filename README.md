# Alien Abduction
Made for Scarlett <3

My first multiplayer game dev project using socket.io and phaser 3 game engine. You can see it live here: http://alien-abduction.herokuapp.com

Simple gameplay -- Collect the most stars while avoiding the UFO!
 - Avatars are assigned at random. Refresh to get a different avatar (30 total).
 - Use the arrow keys to move
 - Stars are redistributed when a player disconnects or is abducted (collides with the UFO).
